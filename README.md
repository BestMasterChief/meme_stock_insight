### Dashboard Card Example

```yaml
type: entities
title: Meme Stock Monitor
entities:
  - entity: sensor.gme_impact_score
    name: "GME Impact"
    icon: mdi:trending-up

    name: "GME Shortable"
  - entity: sensor.amc_impact_score
    name: "AMC Impact"
  - entity: sensor.amc_decline_flag
    name: "AMC Declining"
```

## Impact Score Calculation

The impact score is a weighted composite of four factors:

```
Impact = (40% Ã— Volume) + (30% Ã— Sentiment) + (20% Ã— Momentum) + (10% Ã— Short Interest)
```

- **Volume**: Z-scored post volume vs 30-day baseline
- **Sentiment**: Average VADER sentiment (-1 to +1)
- **Momentum**: 3-day price change momentum
- **Short Interest**: Percentage of float shorted
