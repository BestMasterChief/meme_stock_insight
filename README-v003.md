## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant

   - **Name**: `meme_stock_insight` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Type**: **script** (this is crucial!)
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost` (required field, not used)
5. Note down:
   - **Client ID**: The 14-character string under the app name
   - **Client Secret**: The "secret" string shown

## Troubleshooting

### Reddit Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication errors:

1. **Verify App Type**: Ensure your Reddit app is created as "script" type, not "installed" or "web"
2. **Check Credentials**: Verify client ID, secret, username, and password are correct
3. **Username Match**: The Reddit username in config must be the same as the app owner
4. **2FA**: This integration bypasses 2FA when using password flow
5. **Rate Limiting**: The integration includes polite rate limiting (5 second intervals)

### Common Error Messages

- **"OAuth refused"**: Check app type (must be script), client ID/secret, and user agent
- **"Reddit API refused connection"**: Network connectivity or Reddit API issues  
- **"Credentials accepted but read-only"**: App is not script type or wrong user

## Sensors Created

For each detected stock ticker, the integration creates:

- `sensor.{ticker}_impact_score` - Overall impact score (0-100%)
- `sensor.{ticker}_meme_likelihood` - Probability of being a meme stock (0-100%)
- `sensor.{ticker}_days_active` - Days since first detection
- `sensor.{ticker}_stage` - Current meme stock stage
- `sensor.{ticker}_shortable` - Whether stock can be shorted
- `sensor.{ticker}_decline_flag` - Warning flag for declining interest
- `sensor.{ticker}_volume_score` - Social volume score (0-100%)
- `sensor.{ticker}_sentiment_score` - Sentiment analysis score (0-100%)
- `sensor.{ticker}_momentum_score` - Price momentum score (0-100%)  
- `sensor.{ticker}_short_interest` - Short interest percentage

## Advanced Configuration

### Weighting Factors

The impact score calculation uses these default weights (customizable via options):

- **Volume Weight**: 40% - Social media posting volume
- **Sentiment Weight**: 30% - Positive sentiment analysis  
- **Momentum Weight**: 20% - Price movement momentum
- **Short Interest Weight**: 10% - Short selling interest

### Subreddit Selection

Default monitored subreddits:
- wallstreetbets
- stocks  
- SecurityAnalysis
- investing

You can customize this list during setup or via integration options.
